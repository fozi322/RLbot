# Note
You can uncompile `.pyc` files using [PYLingual](https://pylingual.io). For a tutorial on how to do this, check out [this YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx91kgjHYwc) by PyLingual.

# Usage
Uncompile the `main.pyc` file and modify it as neededâ€”whether you want to crack it, make adjustments, or rebrand the bot. After uncompiled using PYLingual, you can run the script by opening the command line and typing `py main.py`.

- V3 Max Rank: Grand Champion II, Division 1
- V4 Max Rank: Bronze I - Supersonic Legend

# Another Thing
After uncompiled, you can recompile it using `python -m compileall your_file.py`. To convert the project, which includes `.pyc` files, folders, and subfolders, into an executable, you can use the following methods:

### Method 1: PyInstaller
1. Install PyInstaller: `pip install pyinstaller`
2. Navigate to your project directory in the command line.
3. Run PyInstaller with your main script: `pyinstaller --onefile main.py`
4. This will create a single executable file in the `dist` folder within your project directory.

### Method 2: cx_Freeze
1. Install cx_Freeze: `pip install cx_Freeze`
2. Create a `setup.py` file with the following content:
   ```python
   from cx_Freeze import setup, Executable

   setup(
       name="YourAppName",
       version="1.0",
       description="Description of your application",
       executables=[Executable("main.py")]
   )
3. Run the setup script: `python setup.py build`
4. The executable will be generated in the `build` folder within your project directory.
### Method 3: py2exe (Windows only)
1. Install py2exe: `pip install py2exe`
2. Create a `setup.py` file with the following content:
   ```python
   from distutils.core import setup
   import py2exe

   setup(console=['main.py'])
3. Run the setup script: `python setup.py py2exe`
4. The executable will be generated in the `dist` folder within your project directory.
